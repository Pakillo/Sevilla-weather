## Automated Tufte-style weather graphs

This repository creates weather graphs (inspired by [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00014g)) using R's {{ggplot}} package. Updated data is pulled directly from NOAA's FTP servers. The entire process is automated using Github Actions.
